    "short_description": "Since there are four distinctive properties that can be measured with Multimeter click which all require different measuring techniques, several different ICs had to be used on the Click boardâ„¢. Starting with the high-quality, low noise A/D converter as the primary component, all the way to the input operational amplifiers, all components were hand-picked to ensure accuracy.",
